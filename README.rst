Takeoff
=======

To use Takeoff just make sure to rename the top level directory and to replace
everything that is marked with a ``FIXME`` comment.

It encourages you to have:

- docs (with Sphinx_)
- tests (with pytest_)
- a LICENSE file (use `Choose a license`_)

.. _pytest: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest
.. _Sphinx: https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx
.. _Choose a license: http://choosealicense.com/
